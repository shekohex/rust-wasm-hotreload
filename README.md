## Rust + WASM = ðŸ”¥ Hot-Reload ðŸ”¥

A PoC of using WebAssemply as a Hot-Reloadable Code logic at Runtime without restarting the Host Process.

for a simple demo see this [tweet](https://twitter.com/ShekoHex/status/1302973994417651714)

## Try it

First make sure you have both Rust and NodeJS (also NPM) installed.

1. Clone

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/shekohex/rust-wasm-hotreload
```

2. Build

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run asbuild:optimized
$ cargo build
```

3. Run

In one terminal, start build and watch for changes to our AssemplyScript File.

```sh
$ npm run watch
```

in another terminal simply run

```sh
$ cargo run
```

Now, just change the logic in the `assembly/index.ts` file and watch the magic happen :).

### Use Cases

This Project uses [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [AssemblyScript](http://assemblyscript.org/) to address these use cases:

- Scripting (by extending your program with other functionality by using WASM files).
- GameDev (again, it would be useful to add some game logic like (NPCs, Quests, ...etc) as WASM module for easy changes and fast development)
- User-Land Extentions.
- Your Case?

### FAQ

1. Why use [AssemplyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/) rather than Rust for WASM?

Well, let's be honest here... `rustc` compilation-time would kill the whole idea about _Fast Hot Reloadingâ„¢_, and while AssemblyScript compiles so fast, it emits smaller code than `rustc` would and yet it has almost the same performance, and that's why it's a better option for writing code that compiles to WASM.
